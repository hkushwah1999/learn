quote-1 :
	All actions in this life are preceded by mind.
	Mind is their chief. They are made by mind. If one
	speaks or acts with an impure mind, suffering fol-
	lows one like the wagon wheel that follows the foot
	of the ox.


quote-2:
	 All that we are is the result of what we have thought: it is 	 founded on our thoughts, it is made up of our thoughts. If a man 		 speaks or acts with a pure thought, happiness follows him, like a 		 shadow that never leaves him.


quote-3:
	If you tell the truth you don't have to remember anything.
